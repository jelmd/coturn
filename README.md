# Coturn

This is a fork of:

	https://github.com/coturn/coturn.git

It is not actively maintained but used to develop, test and submit
enhancements to the upstream repo.

The **main** branch is the main development branch of this repo.

The **master** branch is used to keep track of the upstream.

Branches starting wih the prefix `wip_` are work in progress branches
and may contain incomplete or not experimental code, which may or may not
compile/work as expected, are not ready yet for PR submission.

Other branches having the master branch as parent are cherry picks of the
wip branches and usually ready for PRs and public testing/fcs.
